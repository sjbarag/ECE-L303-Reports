Next, a DC sweep will be performed on the circuit to view the effects of input
voltage on the duty cycle.  This circuit will be based on the one shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:dc_sweep}.

In this configuration, the negative lead of a DC voltage is connected to pin~8.
With all components as defined as in Figure~\ref{fig:dc_sweep}, the DC voltage
is varied from~\SI{1}{\volt} to~\SI{8}{\volt} in steps of
roughly~\SI{1}{\volt}.  When the input approaches eight volts, the output
quality will degrade.
