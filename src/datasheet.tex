\subsection{Rectifier}
The half wave rectifier was built according to the provided schematic (recreated
in Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, where the value of the resistor was provided
as~\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm} in the instructions.  The input voltage was calculated by
multiplying the specified average voltage of~\SI{5.6}{\volt}DC by~$\pi$ as
shown in Equation~\ref{eq:v_avg}.  This resulted in a peak voltage
of~\SI{17.6}{\volt}DC.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{avg} = \frac{V_p}{\pi}
	\label{eq:v_avg}
\end{equation}
%
To calculate the AC signal's root-mean-square (RMS) value, the peak voltage was
then divided by~$\sqrt{2}$, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:rms}.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{RMS} = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}
	\label{eq:rms}
\end{equation}
%
The resulting calculations provided a designed input of \SI{12.2}{\volt} (RMS).
Using an oscilloscope in combination with a variac transformer, the input was
adjusted to be as close to this value as possible. Data for the half-wave
rectifier was captured by the oscilloscope.  Due to the large number of
measurements taken, it is available by request to the author.

\subsection{Logic Indicator}
The logic indicator was built entirely to the specifications provided by the
course instructors.  Using a \SI{300}{\ohm} resistor in series with the LED
allows for the required current of \SI{15}{\milli\ampere} to flow when the
input voltage is between four and five volts.  That this resistance is correct
can be confirmed via Ohm's law.

In testing the logic indicator, the DC input voltage was stepped from zero to
five volts, while recording the brightness of the LED subjectively at each
step.  The results are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ckt2data}.

\end{figure}

It is interesting to note that for inputs of both~\SI{2}{\volt}
and~\SI{3}{\volt}, the diode appears to be on, albeit dim.  The~\SI{3}{\volt}
case, while brighter than at two volts, is not yet at the full brightness of
the diode.  Full brightness for this diode occurs in the
designed~4--\SI{5}{\volt} range, showing that the final design is adequate in
functioning as a logic level indicator.
