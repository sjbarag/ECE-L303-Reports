\subsection{Rectifier}
The half wave rectifier was buit according to the provided schematic (recreated
in Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, where the value of the resistor was provided
as~\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm} in the instructions.  The input voltage was calculated by
multiplying the specified average voltage of~\SI{5.6}{\volt}DC by~$\pi$ as
shown in Equation~\ref{eq:v_avg}.  This resulted in a peak voltage
of~\SI{17.6}{\volt}DC.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{avg} = \frac{V_p}{\pi}
	\label{eq:v_avg}
\end{equation}
%
To calculate the AC signal's root-mean-square (RMS) value, the peak voltage was
then divided by~$\sqrt{2}$, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:rms}.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{RMS} = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}
	\label{eq:rms}
\end{equation}
%
The resulting calculations provided a designed input of \SI{12.2}{\volt} (RMS).
Using an oscilloscope in combination with a variac transformer, the input was
adjusted to be as close to this value as possible. Data for the half-wave
rectifier was captured by the oscilloscope.  Due to the large number of
measurements taken, it is available by request to the author.
