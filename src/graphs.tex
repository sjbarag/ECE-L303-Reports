After successfully building the voltage regulator circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, an oscilloscope was used to compare the input and
output waveforms.  As screen capture showing these signals (offset in the image
for clarity), as well as the RMS value of the input and average of the output.

The circuit was intially designed for an input of~\SI{12.2}{\volt} RMS and an
average output of~\SI{5.6}{\volt}.  As is shown, the input of~\SI{12.28}{\volt}
RMS is well within reasonable expectations of accuracy.  The measured output
of~\SI{5.251}{\volt}, while lower than expected, is still within reasonable
limits, as it is just~6.23\% below the designed value.  Inconsistencies with
the variac transformer and a resistance that was slightly below its
rated~\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm} likely contributed to this, along with small
capacitances in the oscilloscopes.
