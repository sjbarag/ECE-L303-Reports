In the interest of maintaining the flow and ease of readibility of this
document, all measured data is tabulated in the Appendix.

\subsection{Free Running Oscillator}
After completing a full capacitance test, the recorded data was graphed, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:free_run_c}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/free_run_c.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Free Running Oscillator --- Varying $C_T$]{Recorded data for the
	varying capacitance test for a free running oscillator.  Note that the duty
	cycle remains reasonably constant above~\SI{0.01}{\micro\farad}, while the
	frequency decreases continuously.}
	\label{fig:free_run_c}}
\end{figure}
%
As is shown, the measured output frequency decreases linearly as the
capacitance increases (when plotted on a logarithmic scale), at a rate of
approximately~\SI{44.5}{\kilo\hertz\per\micro\farad}.  This is in line with the
expected behavior dictated by~\eqref{eq:t0_even}.  Similarly, the output's duty
cycle remains roughly constant for values over~\SI{0.01}{\micro\farad}, varying
at a rate of just~\SI{0.06}{\percent\per\micro\farad}.  Figure~\ref{fig:shot1}
shows the output signal for both a square wave and a triangular wave where the
value of~$C_T$ is~\SI{0.01}{\micro\farad}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/shot/shot1.png}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Free Running Oscillator --- Varying~$C_T$ at~\SI{49.9}{\percent}
	Duty Cycle]{Oscilloscope capture of the triangular and square wave outputs
	of the VCO for a capacitance of~\SI{0.01}{\micro\farad}.  Note that the
	maximums of the triangular wave are synchronized with the rising edge of
	the square wave, implying an equal frequency for each.}
	\label{fig:shot1}}
\end{figure}
%
It is significant to note that the triangular wave has the same period as the
square wave in this screenshot, and that this will occur for all configurations
of the VCO.  As such, the triangular wave is omitted from all future
screenshots, as instructed by the course director.  While this configuration is
not an ideal~\SI{50}{\percent} duty cycle, it occurs at the capacitance above which
the duty cycle changes very little.  Additionally, said capacitance is one
element below the median value of the tested data set.

Similarly, the results of a varied resistance~$R_A$ can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:free_run_r}, below.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/free_run_r.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Free Running Oscillator --- Varying $R_A$]{Measured data for a
	varied resistance, as measured by an in-lab oscilloscope.}
	\label{fig:free_run_r}}
\end{figure}
%
In a striking contrast to the varying capacitor, a varying resistor shows a
consistently varying duty cycle and frequency.  This is expected behavior,
however, as described by~\eqref{eq:t0}.  It is interesting to note here the
peak value of the output frequency~(\SI{10.72}{\kilo\hertz} occurred at a
resistance of~\SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}, as this is also where the duty cycle was
measured closest to~\SI{50}{\percent}, at~\SI{49.2}{\percent}.
As~\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} is the value of~$R_A$ used in the varying-capacitance
case~(which produced a roughly fifty-percent duty cycle for more than half of
its test range), this intuitively makes sense.  The waveform at this point can
be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:shot4}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/shot/shot4.png}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Free Running Oscillator --- Varying $R_A$ at \SI{49.2}{\percent}
	Duty Cycle]{Screenshot of the free-running oscillator when the timing
	resistor $R_A$ is set at~\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}}
	\label{fig:shot4}}
\end{figure}
%
As is expected, the frequency~(\SI{10.72}{\kilo\ohm} here
vs.\ \SI{10.97}{\kilo\ohm} previously) and duty cycle~(\SI{49.2}{\percent} here
vs.\ \SI{48.7}{\percent} previously) match closely the values recorded for the
system when~$C_T$ was varied, under roughly the same element values.  As an
extension of this test, students were asked to examine the fringe behavior of a
varying $R_A$ when it grows to be too large.  A maximum value
of~\SI{100}{\kilo\ohm} was used, and another oscilloscope screenshot was
captured.  It is shown here in Figure~\ref{fig:shot3}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/shot/shot3.png}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Free Running Oscillator --- Varying $R_A$ at \SI{95.2}{\percent}
	Duty Cycle]{Edge-case behavior for a varying~$R_A$, showing a drastic
	change in duty cycle for a resistance change of just one order of
	magnitude.}
	\label{fig:shot3}}
\end{figure}
%
The captured oscilloscope data for the edge case of a varying timing resistor
shows that the data trends observed in Figure~\ref{fig:free_run_r} continue to
hold true for a much larger range of values.  What's more, this result shows
the importance of properly managing the value of the timing resistor.  If it
grows too large or, by extrapolation of the existing trends, too small, the
duty cycle of the output wave will extend toward~\SI{100}{\percent}
or~\SI{0}{\percent}, respectively.

\subsection{DC Sweep}
Next, the effects of a varying input voltage on the frequency of the output
square wave were examined.  A graphical representation of the measured results
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dc_sweep_plot}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/dc_sweep.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[DC Sweep Results]{Measured results of varying the input
	voltage~$V+$ on the frequency of the output square wave.}
	\label{fig:dc_sweep_plot}}
\end{figure}
%
Even without careful consideration, it is quite obvious that the output
frequency increases linearly with increasing input voltage at a rate
of~\SI{1.824}{\kilo\hertz\per\volt}.  This intuitively makes sense, as
varying~$V+$ linearly varies the voltage across each of the~\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}
resistors shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dc_sweep} by Ohm's Law.  An oscilloscope
screenshot for the system fed with a~\SI{5}{\volt} DC signal is shown below in
Figure~\ref{fig:shot5}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/shot/shot5.png}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[DC Sweep at \SI{5}{\volt}]{Oscilloscope capture of the square wave
	output during the DC sweep test, where the input voltage was set
	to~\SI{5}{\volt}.  Note that the duty cycle remained
	roughly~\SI{50}{\percent} across the entire range of input voltages.}
	\label{fig:shot5}}
\end{figure}
%
The duty cycle of the output square wave remained reasonably close
to~\SI{50}{\percent} throughout this test, matching the value measured for
a~\SI{5}{\volt} input.

\subsection{Frequency Modulation}
After reconfiguring the circuit to match the schematic shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:freq_mod}, students recorded and measured the variance in
output period resulting from a sinusoidal input wave.  The results of such a
test are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:freq_mod_period}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/freq_mod.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Frequency Modulation --- Period Variance]{Recorded data for the
	frequency modulated test.  Note that the period changes more drastically as
	the amplitude of the signal increases.}
	\label{fig:freq_mod_period}}
\end{figure}
%
While the output period varied very little~(just~\SI{1.2}{\micro\second}) in
the case of a~\SI{1}{\volt} sinusoid, the variance increased as the amplitude
of the signal increased: a~\SI{2}{\volt} signal caused the period to increase
by~\SI{2.8}{\micro\second}, and a~\SI{3}{\volt} sinusoid caused an increase
of~\SI{4.6}{\micro\second}.
%
Oscilloscope screenshots for each of the three input amplitudes can be seen in
Figures~\ref{fig:shot7} through~\ref{fig:shot9}.
