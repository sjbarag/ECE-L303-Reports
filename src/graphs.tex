Once this procedure has been completed,
a~\SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm} resistor was placed in parallel with both~$R_1$ and~$R_2$
to for an adequate load.  The source voltage was subsequently swept from~6
to~\SI{30}{\volt} in order to test the line regulation of the IC, or the amount
of change in output per change in input.  Simlarly, the load regulation (change
in output per change in load) of the IC was tested by using a
static~\SI{18}{\volt} source and replacing the load resistor for a decade box.
This resistance was varied from~\SI{100}{\ohm} to~\SI{3.2}{\kilo\ohm}.
