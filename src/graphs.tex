\subsection{Initial Testing}
Upon beginning the experiment, students were first instructed to test the provided circuit to ensure that it is working.  While powered, the pin labeled~$V_\text{CC}$ was to measure~\SI{5}{\volt}, the LEDs were to measure~\SI{3.2}{\volt}, and pin 3 of the DAC was to measure around~\SI{-14}{\volt}.  These values were recorded and are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:initTest}.

Next, the student shorted the input terminal to ground, ensuring that all eight LEDs from the ADC were lit.  The voltage at the DAC's output was measured at~\SI{-1.4}{\milli\volt}~--- reasonably close to the expected value of zero volts, implying proper operation.
