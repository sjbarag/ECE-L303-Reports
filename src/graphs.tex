\subsection{Step Response}
After completing a simulation of the system's step response, the plot shown
in Figure~\ref{f:stepSim} was produced by PSpice.

	the square signal in red is the input to the system, whereas the green
	curved signal is the output.}

\end{figure}

This same test was repeated for the constructed circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{f:realSchem}, while measuring the output on the in-lab
oscilloscope.  The resulting waveforms are shown in Figure~\ref{f:stepReal}.

While there are similarities between the two resulting output signals, it is
significant to note that the simulated response exhibits Gibbs phenomena on the
leading transition of every wave, while the measured output does not show any
effects of Gibbs' phenomena, in fact failing to exceed the amplitude of the
input.
