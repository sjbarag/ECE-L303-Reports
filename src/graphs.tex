\subsection{Rectifier Circuit}
The rectifier circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem} was tested in three
configurations: once with no filter capacitor, once with a~\SI{1}{\micro\farad}
capacitor, and once with a~\SI{100}{\micro\farad}.  Additionally, the
peak-to-peak voltage, average voltage, and minimum voltage were measured using
an oscilloscope in each configuration, a screenshot of which is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rectShots}.

	div}, while the others are~\SI{5}{\volt\per div}.}
	\label{fig:rectShots}}
\end{figure}
%
Data measured by the oscilloscope matches almost exactly the output expected
from the bridge rectifier shown in Figures~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOut}
and~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOutFilt}.  As the size of the filtering capacitor
increases, the output variation decreases.  For each rectifier circuit, the minimum, average, and maximum
values of each waveform were recorded and tabulated into
Table~\ref{tab:rectData}.
%
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\input{tbl/rectData.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Rectifier data]{Tabulated data from the experiments on the bridge
	rectifier.  Note the sharp decrease in peak-to-peak voltage introduced by
	the filtering capacitor.}
	\label{tab:rectData}
	}
\end{table}
%
The recorded values match what is expected of these circuits: as the capacitor
value increases, peak-to-peak voltage decreases sharply, the average value
increases, and the minimum value greatly increases (as a result of the previous
two changes).


\subsection{IC}
Once this procedure has been completed, a~\SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm} resistor was
placed in parallel with both~$R_1$ and~$R_2$ to for an adequate load.  The
source voltage was subsequently swept from~6 to~\SI{30}{\volt} in order to test
the line regulation of the IC, or the amount of change in output per change in
input.  Measurements at each step were recorded and plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:vrLineReg}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/vrLineReg.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption[Plot --- Line regulation of LM723]{Measured data for the line
	regulation tests on the LM723 circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:icSchem}.  The
	source voltage was varied from~6 to~\SI{30}{\volt}, while holding a constant
	load.}
	\label{fig:vrLineReg}
	}
\end{figure}
%
In the flat region of the graph (from inputs of~\SI{10}{\volt}
to~\SI{30}{\volt}), the maximum value is~\SI{8.06}{\volt} and the minimum value
is~\SI{8.01}{\volt}.  By using the formula for line regulation in
Equation~\eqref{eq:lineReg}
%
\begin{equation}
	\text{Line Regulation} = \frac{\Delta V_\text{out}}{V_\text{out}} \times 100 \qquad \text{,}
	\label{eq:lineReg}
\end{equation}
%
the line regulation of the IC regulator on its own is calculated to
be~\SI{5.02}{\percent}.

By a similar process, the load regulation (change in output per change in load)
of the IC was tested by using a static~\SI{18}{\volt} source and replacing the
load resistor for a decade box.  This resistance was varied from~\SI{100}{\ohm}
to~\SI{3.2}{\kilo\ohm}, and measurements were plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:vrLoadReg}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/vrLoadReg.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption[Plot -- Load regulation of LM723]{Data recorded while testing the
	load regulation of the LM723 circuit depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:icSchem}.
	Unlike the line regulation tests, the source voltage was held constant
	while the input resistance varied from~100 to~\SI{3200}{\ohm}.}
	\label{fig:vrLoadReg}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Line regulation is calculated as in Equation~\eqref{eq:loadReg} by subtracting
the output at the minimum load from the output at maximum load and dividing the
difference by the output with a nominal load, or
%
\begin{equation}
	\text{Load Regulation} = \frac{V_\text{max R} - V_\text{min R}}{V_\text{nominal}} \times 100 \qquad \text{.}
	\label{eq:loadReg}
\end{equation}
%
In the case of the voltage regulator IC on its own, the load regulation is
equal to~$\frac{8.07-8.06}{8.06} \times 100$, or~\SI{0.12}{\percent}.


\subsection{Full Regulator}
Once the completed circuit was built as in Figure~\ref{fig:fullSchem}, the load
regulation was again determined.  This time, however, the range of resistances
was reduced to~100 to~\SI{2000}{\ohm}.  Output voltage measurements at each step are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fullLoadReg}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/fullLoadReg.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption[Plot --- Load regulation of combined circuit]{Load regulation data
	for the completed voltage regulator circuit.  The load resistance varied in
	this test from~\SI{100}{\ohm} to~\SI{2}{\kilo\ohm}.}
	\label{fig:fullLoadReg}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Utilizing again Equation~\eqref{eq:loadReg}, the load regulation for the
completed voltage regulator is calculated to be~$\frac{8.06-8.03}{8.06} \times
100$, or just~\SI{0.37}{\percent}.

\subsection{Graphical Measurements}
After completing the load regulation measurements on the combined circuit, the
oscilloscope was used to help compare the output of the transofmer, output of
the filtered bridge rectifier, and the final output of the system.  Screenshots
of these waveforms can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:100uFshots}.

	\label{fig:100uFshots}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Each screenshot shows the minimum, average, and peak-to-peak voltage for the
contained waveform.

The capacitor~$C_1$ in the rectifier's filter was swapped out for
the~\SI{1}{\micro\farad} capacitor used previously, and the same oscilloscope
screenshots were taken.  These are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1uFshots}.

	differences from the images shown in Figure~\ref{fig:100uFshots}.}
	\label{fig:1uFshots}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Clearly this configuration does not provided enough voltage for the IC to
remain on, as there are flat spots in Figure~\ref{fig:regOut1} and a very large
peak-to-peak variance remaining.

The values depicted in the final sets of oscilloscope screenshots  have been
combined into Tables~\ref{tab:100uFdata} and~\ref{tab:1uFdata}, below, for
better ease of understanding and comparison.
