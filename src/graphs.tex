\subsection{Step Response}
After completing a simulation of the system's step response, the plot shown
in Figure~\ref{f:stepSim} was produced by PSpice.

	the square signal in red is the input to the system, whereas the green
	curved signal is the output.}
	\label{f:stepSim}}
\end{figure}

This same test was repeated for the constructed circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{f:realSchem}, while measuring the output on the in-lab
oscilloscope.  The resulting waveforms are shown in Figure~\ref{f:stepReal}.

	upper signal~(A1) is the input, while the lower~(A2) is the output.}
	\label{f:stepReal}}
\end{figure}
%
While there are similarities between the two resulting output signals, it is
significant to note that the simulated response exhibits Gibbs phenomena on the
leading transition of every wave, while the measured output does not show any
effects of Gibbs' phenomena, in fact failing to exceed the amplitude of the
input.

\subsection{Frequency Response}
% -117.523 - -57.519 dB/dec
The frequency sweep simulation described above produced the plot shown in
Figure~\ref{f:bodePlotSim}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\input{img/plot/bodePlotSim.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Simulated Bode Plot]{Resulting data from the PSpice simulation of
	the third-order low pass filter for a sweeping input frequency.}
	\label{f:bodePlotSim}}
\end{figure}
%
As can be seen, the system's frequency response represents a low pass filter
with a corner frequency near the target~$f_c$ of~\SI{363}{\hertz}.  The
terminal slope of the linear region is equal
to~\SI{-60.004}{\decibel\per dec}, which aligns with the expected behavior
of an ideal third-order filter~(i.e.~\SI{20}{\decibel\per dec} for
first-order,~\SI{40}{\decibel\per dec} for second-order, etc.).
