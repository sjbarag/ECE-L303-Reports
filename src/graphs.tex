\subsection{Rectifier Circuit}
The rectifier circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem} was tested in three
configurations: once with no filter capacitor, once with a~\SI{1}{\micro\farad}
capacitor, and once with a~\SI{100}{\micro\farad}.  Additionally, the
peak-to-peak voltage, average voltage, and minimum voltage were measured using
an oscilloscope in each configuration, a screenshot of which is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rectShots}.

	\label{fig:rectShots}}
\end{figure}
%
Data measured by the oscilloscope matches almost exactly the output expected
from the bridge rectifier shown in Figures~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOut}
and~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOutFilt}.  As the size of the filtering capacitor
increases, the output variation decreases.  For each rectifier circuit, the minimum, average, and maximum
values of each waveform were recorded and tabulated into
table~\ref{tab:rectData}.
%
\begin{table}[H]

	rectifier.  Note the sharp decrease in peak-to-peak voltage introduced by
	the filtering capacitor.}
	\label{tab:rectData}
	}
\end{table}
%
The recorded values match what is expected of these circuits: as the capacitor
value increases, peak-to-peak voltage decreases sharply, the average value
increases, and the minimum value greatly increases (as a result of the previous
two changes).


\subsection{IC}
Once this procedure has been completed, a~\SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm} resistor was
placed in parallel with both~$R_1$ and~$R_2$ to for an adequate load.  The
source voltage was subsequently swept from~6 to~\SI{30}{\volt} in order to test
the line regulation of the IC, or the amount of change in output per change in
input.  Measurements at each step were recorded and plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:vrLineReg}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/vrLineReg.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption[Plot --- Line regulation of LM723]{Measured data for the line
	regulation tests on the LM723 circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:icSchem}.  The
	source voltage was varied from~6 to~\SI{30}{\volt}, while holding a constant
	load.}
	\label{fig:vrLineReg}
	}
\end{figure}
%
In the flat region of the graph (from inputs of~\SI{10}{\volt}
to~\SI{30}{\volt}), the maximum value is~\SI{8.06}{\volt} and the minimum value
is~\SI{8.01}{\volt}.  By using the formula for line regulation in
Equation~\eqref{eq:lineReg}
%
\begin{equation}
	\text{Line Regulation} = \frac{\Delta V_\text{out}}{V_\text{out}} \times 100 \qquad \text{,}
	\label{eq:lineReg}
\end{equation}
%
the line regulation of the IC regulator on its own is calculated to
be~\SI{5.02}{\percent}.

By a similar process, the load regulation (change in output per change in load)
of the IC was tested by using a static~\SI{18}{\volt} source and replacing the
load resistor for a decade box.  This resistance was varied from~\SI{100}{\ohm}
to~\SI{3.2}{\kilo\ohm}, and measurements were plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:vrLoadReg}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/vrLoadReg.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption[Plot -- Load regulation of LM723]{Data recorded while testing the
	load regulation of the LM723 circuit depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:icSchem}.
	Unlike the line regulation tests, the source voltage was held constant
	while the input resistance varied from~100 to~\SI{3200}{\ohm}.}
	\label{fig:vrLoadReg}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Line regulation is calculated as in Equation~\eqref{eq:loadReg} by subtracting
the output at the minimum load from the output at maximum load and dividing the
difference by the output with a nominal load, or
%
\begin{equation}
	\text{Load Regulation} = \frac{V_\text{max R} - V_\text{min R}}{V_\text{nominal}} \times 100 \qquad \text{.}
	\label{eq:loadReg}
\end{equation}
%
In the case of the voltage regulator IC on its own, the load regulation is
equal to~$\frac{8.07-8.06}{8.07} \times 100$, or~\SI{0.123}{\percent}.
