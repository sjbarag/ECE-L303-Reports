In conclusion, a functioning --- albeit slightly limited --- sine wave
generator was successfully constructed.  While it can output various
amplitudes, the frequency of the signal is very much limited by the fixed-value
elements that were used.  In order to vary the frequency, either all of the
capcitors or all of the fixed-value resistors in this circuit would need to be
adjusted simultaneously.
