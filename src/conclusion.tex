In conclusion, the student was able to produce a working voltage regulator that
output roughly~\SI{8}{\volt}DC for varying loads.  The student also gained
familiarity with the~LM723 family of voltage regulators, as well as the effects
of filter capacitor size on the output of a bridge rectifier circuit.
