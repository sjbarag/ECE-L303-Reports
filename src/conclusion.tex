In conclusion, each simulated circuit performed exactly how it was expected to.
The complexity of Cadence PSpice helped to account for non-ideal conditions,
such as varying temperatures, inefficiencies, and even environmental variance,
thus proving itself yet again as an invaluable tool to engineers designing new
systems.
