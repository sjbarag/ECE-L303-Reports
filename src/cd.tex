Unlike the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) explored in lab five, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) attempts to take a stream of binary values and convert it into a continuous waveform.  Because there is a limited set of~$2^n$ values that can possibly be described by an~$n$-bit DAC, the resulting signal appears to be quantized as in the example in Figure~\ref{fig:theory}.

\end{figure}
While the output signal is not continuous as a~``traditional'' analog signal would be, it is still considered analog because of its varying voltage.  Additionally, consider the case of a higher-quality DAC with faster clock frequency and higher resolution.  As the difference between any two time steps~$t_i$ and~$T_{i+1}$ approaches zero and the difference between any two voltages~$V_i$ and~$V_{i+1}$ approaches zero, the output more greatly resembles a continuous and~``traditional'' analog signal.
