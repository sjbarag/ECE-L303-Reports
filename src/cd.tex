\subsection{Design}
Students designed the appropriate circuit during the pre-lab phase of the
experiment.  Given a target corner frequency of~\SI{363}{\hertz} and
a~\SI{100}{\milli\henry} inductor, students calculated values for the
capacitors~$C_1$ and~$C_2$ and the resistor~$R_0$ from the provided layout
shown in Figure~\ref{f:prelabSchem}.

	\label{f:prelabSchem}}
\end{figure}
%
After students completed their computation,~$R_0$ was found to
be~\SI{513}{\ohm}, $C_1$ to be~\SI{142}{\nano\farad}, and~$C_2$ to
be~\SI{427}{\nano\farad}.

\subsection{Simulation}
Students next obtained circuit components that were as close to the required
values as possible.  The measured and required values are tabulated below in
Table~\ref{t:components}.

	element values for the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{f:prelabSchem}.  The
	element~$R_L$ refers to the intrinsic resistance of the inductor.}
	\label{t:components}}
\end{table}
%
These element values were used to create a PSpice simulation, the schematic for
which is shown in Figure~\ref{f:pspiceSchem}.  Note the presence of the
element~$R_L$, which was used in PSpice to simulate the intrinsic resistance of
the inductor.  This is reflected in the circuit schematic.

This circuit was tested with two inputs: a five volt impulse lasting for a time
equal to half the period of the target corner
frequency~($\frac{1}{\SI{363}{\hertz}} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$), and a sinusoidal
signal of varying frequency.
