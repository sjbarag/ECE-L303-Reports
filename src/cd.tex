An $n$-bit analog-to-digital converter functions --- at least at a high level
--- by mapping a capped range of input voltages (typically starting at zero and ending
at some full-scale voltage~$V_\text{FS}$) into~$2^n$ discrete, non-intersecting
values, sometimes labeled~$V_i$.  The output voltage is simply the largest
discretized voltage that the input exceeds.  Because an analog input voltage is
being represented by one of a finite set of discrete values, the index~$i$ of
the corresponding output~$V_i$ can be expressed as a series of~$2^n$ binary
bits.

When the input is a time-varying signal, the converter samples the input
at a regular frequency~$f_s$, producing a new output as previously described
for each sample.  An example of such a sampling and the digital output signal
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:theory}.

While the digital output of this arbitrary signal resembles the input, it is
clearly not very accurate.  This is a combined result of the resolution and
sampling frequency being far too low.  An increased resolution (here only
3-bits, or~$2^3 = 8$ possible values) would allow the maximum value of the
signal located at~$t_4$ to be represented, eliminating the flat region
between~$t_2$ and~$t_7$.  Likewise, increasing the sampling frequency would
prevent a value from being skipped as~$V_3$ is at~$t_{10}$.
