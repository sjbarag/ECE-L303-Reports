Students built a full voltage regulator in two preliminary stages: one to test
the bridge rectifier on its own, and one to test the voltage regulator IC.  The
design process for each of these stages is explained below.

\subsection{Bridge Rectifier}
In order to output a constant DC voltage, the AC component of
the~\SI{120}{\volt} input must first be removed.  After passing the input
through a~10:1 transformer, the input signal is routed through a configuration
of PN junctions known as a bridge rectifier.  This configuration allows current
to flow through its output resistor in only one direction, thus removing the AC
characteristics from the signal in favor of a varying DC one.  Such a circuit
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem}.

	instructions.  Note that $C_1$ is added at a later period and is not part
	of the bridge rectifier circuit.}
	\label{fig:bridgeSchem}}
\end{figure}
%
The input and output of the bridge rectifier (after the signal passes through the transformer) is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOut} for the case that the input signal is defined
by~$12 \sin(60t)$.  Note the differences between this waveform and the
half-wave rectifier built in lab one.

	one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem}.  The input is shown in blue with
	a solid line, whereas the output is shown in red with a dashed line.}
	\label{fig:bridgeRectOut}
	}
\end{figure}
%
As is clearly shown, the period of the output signal is twice that of the
input, or in this case~$\frac{1}{120}$\si{\second} and the average value of the
output is, as intuition would dictate, also twice the average of the input,
at~$V_\text{avg} = \frac{2 V_p}{\pi}$.  Conversely, the peak value of the
output is calculated using the same method as the input,
where~$V_P=\sqrt{2}V_\mathrm{RMS}$.
