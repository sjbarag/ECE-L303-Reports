The first circuit built was a half-wave rectifier, utilizing a 1N4006 PN junction diode as the primary element because of its directional current flow property.  When forward biased (acheived when the voltage on the p-doped side is higher than the voltage on the n-doped side), a standard diode will allow current to flow; a reverse biased, however, no current will flow.  If said diode is connected in series with a load resistor between the two inputs of an AC signal as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, a half-wave rectifier results.

, the voltage across the resistor will be equal to the input when the signal is greater than zero.  When the signal becomes negative, the voltage across
