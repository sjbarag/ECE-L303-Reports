Students built a full voltage regulator in two preliminary stages: one to test
the bridge rectifier on its own, and one to test the voltage regulator IC.  The
design process for each of these stages is explained below.

\subsection{Bridge Rectifier}
In order to output a constant DC voltage, the AC component of
the~\SI{120}{\volt} input must first be removed.  After passing the input
through a~10:1 transformer, the input signal is routed through a configuration
of PN junctions known as a bridge rectifier.  This configuration allows current
to flow through its output resistor in only one direction, thus removing the AC
characteristics from the signal in favor of a varying DC one.  Such a circuit
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem}.

	\input{schem/bridgeRect.tex}

	\caption{Bridge rectifier schematic as provided in the lab three
	instructions.  Note that $C_1$ is added at a later period and is not part
	of the bridge rectifier circuit.}
	\label{fig:bridgeSchem}}
\end{figure}
%
The input and output of the bridge rectifier (after the signal passes through the transformer) is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOut} for the case that the input signal is defined
by~$12 \sin(60t)$.  Note the differences between this waveform and the
half-wave rectifier built in lab one.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/theory-Bridge1.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption{Theoretical input and output for a bridge rectifier such as the
	one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem}.  The input is shown in blue with
	a solid line, whereas the output is shown in red with a dashed line.}
	\label{fig:bridgeRectOut}
	}
\end{figure}
%
As is clearly shown, the period of the output signal is twice that of the
input, or in this case~$\frac{1}{120}$\si{\second} and the average value of the
output is, as intuition would dictate, also twice the average of the input,
at~$V_\text{avg} = \frac{2 V_p}{\pi}$.  Conversely, the peak value of the
output is calculated using the same method as the input,
where~$V_P=\sqrt{2}V_\mathrm{RMS}$.

\subsection{Filtered Rectifier}
The bridge rectifier shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeSchem} does not by any
means resemble a constant DC voltage.  To fix this, a filtering capacitor
(drawn in dashed lines) is installed in parallel with the load resistor.  If
the value of the capacitor is chosen such that the time constant~$RC$ is much
larger than the period~$T$ of the signal it filters, then a significant
improvement in output consistency results, as displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOutFilt}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/theory-Bridge2.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption{Output of the filtered bridge rectifier; waveform A depicts a
	large~RC value compared to~$T$, while waveform B depicts a small one.}
	\label{fig:bridgeRectOutFilt}
	}
\end{figure}
%
Whereas in the unfiltered case the average value of the output was~$\frac{2
V_p}{\pi}$, the DC level of the filtered signal is measured as halfway between
the maximum and minimum values shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeRectOutFilt}.
Additionally, the ``ripple voltage,''~$V_r$ is greatly reduced here, as it is
calculated by~$V_\text{max} - V_\text{min}$.  This is a tremendous improvement
over the bridge rectifier alone, but will be improved further by passing this
output to an~LM723 voltage regulation IC.
