The overall objective for experiment two involved providing students with
additional experience with Cadence PSpice.  This was accomplished by asking
students to simulate the half-wave rectifier, voltage regulator, constant
current source, and voltage follower from experiment one.  These circuits were
significant in that they allowd students to use more advanced simulation
techniques, including transient analysis, voltage sweeps, parameter sweeps, and
customized component models.
