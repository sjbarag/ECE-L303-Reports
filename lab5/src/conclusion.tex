In conclusion, the ADC created in experiment five was extremely accurate once tuned.  It was capable of providing~256 bits of resolution, which, over a five volt input range, allowed just~\SI{19}{\milli\volt\per\bit}.  For a two volt input range, the voltage resolution improved to~\SI{7.84}{\milli\volt\per\bit}.  An untuned system, however, provides a limited voltage resolution of~\SI{21}{\milli\volt\per\bit} for a five volt range.  This difference in output resolution will allow a much more accurate representation of the input signal, and shows the importance of properly setting the reference voltage~$V_\text{REF}$ for the given input range.  While the system is limited only to positive input voltages and correct tuning can only occur when the input range is known, these facts must be known for any electronic system, whether used commercially or for personal use.  Calculating a valid input range is not just the mark of a high-quality engineer; it is required for every engineer.
