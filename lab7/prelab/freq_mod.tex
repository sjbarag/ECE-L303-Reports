Finally, the voltage-controlled oscillator was fed a frequency modulated
sinusoid.  The results of the DC sweep should imply the expected result for
this test, in which the duty cycle of the output oscillates.

For this experiment all previously-used components are unchanged, and the new
resistor and capacitor are~\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} and~\SI{10}{\micro\farad},
respectively.  In this case, the amplitude of the input signal determines the
frequency of the output, which will vary from~\SI{1}{\volt} to~\SI{4}{\volt} in
one-volt increments.  For each of these amplitudes, the input frequency will
vary from~\SI{1}{\hertz} to~\SI{4}{\hertz}.  This allows students to view the
effects of a varying amplitude on the output frequency, while observing the
effects of a varying input frequency on the rate of change of the output's duty
cycle.
