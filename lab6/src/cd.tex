Unlike the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) explored in lab five, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) attempts to take a stream of binary values and convert it into a continuous waveform.  Because there is a limited set of~$2^n$ values that can possibly be described by an~$n$-bit DAC, the resulting signal appears to be quantized as in the example in Figure~\ref{fig:theory}.

While the output signal is not continuous as a~``traditional'' analog signal would be, it is still considered analog because of its varying voltage.  Additionally, consider the case of a higher-quality DAC with faster clock frequency and higher resolution.  As the difference between any two time steps~$t_i$ and~$T_{i+1}$ approaches zero and the difference between any two voltages~$V_i$ and~$V_{i+1}$ approaches zero, the output more greatly resembles a continuous and~``traditional'' analog signal.

As with the ADC, a pre-constructed DAC circuit was provided to students in order to simplify the process of exploring the properties of such a system.  A schematic for the pre-built DAC is shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:dacSchem}.

To make the process even simpler for students, the digital inputs were wired directly to the corresponding bits of a known-working ADC, such as the one used in the previous week.  Since every other pin has been properly connected, students must only focus on the voltage that appears at pin~4.  Note that because of the configuration of the~\SI{5}{\kilo\ohm} resistor, the output voltage will always be negative, as given in the lab instructions by~\eqref{eq:vout}:
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{out} = - V_\text{REF} \left( \frac{A_0}{2} + \frac{A_1}{4} + \ldots + \frac{A_7}{256} \right) \quad \text{,}
	\label{eq:vout}
\end{equation}
%
where~$A_0$ through~$A_7$ represent the eight bits of input to the DAC.  Regardless, pin four was wired directly to an input of an oscilloscope was measured throughout the experiment.
