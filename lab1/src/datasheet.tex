\subsection{Rectifier}
The half wave rectifier was built according to the provided schematic (recreated
in Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, where the value of the resistor was provided
as~\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm} in the instructions.  The input voltage was calculated by
multiplying the specified average voltage of~\SI{5.6}{\volt}DC by~$\pi$ as
shown in Equation~\ref{eq:v_avg}.  This resulted in a peak voltage
of~\SI{17.6}{\volt}DC.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{avg} = \frac{V_p}{\pi}
	\label{eq:v_avg}
\end{equation}
%
To calculate the AC signal's root-mean-square (RMS) value, the peak voltage was
then divided by~$\sqrt{2}$, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:rms}.
%
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{RMS} = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}
	\label{eq:rms}
\end{equation}
%
The resulting calculations provided a designed input of~\SI{12.2}{\volt} (RMS).
Using an oscilloscope in combination with a variac transformer, the input was
adjusted to be as close to this value as possible. Data for the half-wave
rectifier was captured by the oscilloscope.  Due to the large number of
measurements taken, it is available by request to
\texttt{sean.barag@gmail.com}.  Additionally, an I-V curve was traced in the
lab and can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:diodeCurve}.

\subsection{Logic Indicator}
The logic indicator was built entirely to the specifications provided by the
course instructors.  Using a~\SI{300}{\ohm} resistor in series with the LED
allows for the required current of~\SI{15}{\milli\ampere} to flow when the
input voltage is between four and five volts.  That this resistance is correct
can be confirmed via Ohm's law.

In testing the logic indicator, the DC input voltage was stepped from zero to
five volts, while recording the brightness of the LED subjectively at each
step.  The results are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ckt2data}.

		Figure~\ref{fig:schem2}.}
	\label{tab:ckt2data}}
\end{figure}
%
It is interesting to note that for inputs of both~\SI{2}{\volt}
and~\SI{3}{\volt}, the diode appears to be on, albeit dim.  The~\SI{3}{\volt}
case, while brighter than at two volts, is not yet at the full brightness of
the diode.  Full brightness for this diode occurs in the
designed~4--\SI{5}{\volt} range, showing that the final design is adequate in
functioning as a logic level indicator.

\subsection{Voltage Regulator}
As with the rectifier and logic indicator, the voltage regulator was built
according to the provided design.  The value of the~\SI{400}{\ohm} resistor is
mostly irrelevant, as its sole purpose is to drop the difference between the
zener diode's reverse breakdown voltage and the input voltage.  As long as the
resistor is large enough to limit the current through the diode to safe levels
(as indicated by the part's datasheet), its specific value does not affect the
output drastically.  To confirm that a given resistor ensures diode safety,
Ohm's law again becomes useful.  Recorded values for the voltage regulator
circuit are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ckt3data}.

	\input{tbl/circuit3.tex}\\
	\parbox{4.5in}{
	\caption{Output measurements of the zener diode voltage
		regulator described in Figure~\ref{fig:schem3}.}
	\label{tab:ckt3data}}
\end{figure}
%
The reverse breakdown voltage of the zener diode was tested in a curve tracer
prior to the experiment, the results of which are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:zenerCurve}.  For this specific diode, $V_z$ is
approximately~\SI{1.9}{\volt}.  As was expected, the data captured indicates
that the voltage was regulated at roughly~\SI{10.2}{\volt}.  The zener diode is
not a perfect regulator however, hence the variation in output voltage.  This
is mostly due to variances as the package temperature increases and the innate
properties of the zener diode as a device.

\subsection{Constant Current Source}
There were no calculations required to build the constant current source
circuit, as the resistance was set by a decade box, and the drain voltage was
determined by the experiment instructions.  The curve tracer output for the
JFET used is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:jfetCurve}.

		and~\SI{32}{\volt}, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:schem4}}
