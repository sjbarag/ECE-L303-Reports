\subsection{Rectifier}
After successfully building the voltage regulator circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}, an oscilloscope was used to compare the input and
output waveforms.  The screen was captured showing these signals (offset in the
image for clarity), as well as the RMS value of the input and average of the
output; it is included here in Figure~\ref{fig:ckt1plot}
%
\begin{figure}[H]

	\parbox{4.25in}{\caption{Oscilloscope screenshot of the completed half-wave rectifier
		outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:schem1}.  Signal one is the input, whereas
		signal two is the output across the resistor.}
	\label{fig:ckt1plot}}
\end{figure}
%
The circuit was initially designed for an input of~\SI{12.2}{\volt} RMS and an
average output of~\SI{5.6}{\volt}.  As is shown, the input of~\SI{12.28}{\volt}
RMS is well within reasonable expectations of accuracy.  The measured output
of~\SI{5.251}{\volt}, while lower than expected, is still within reasonable
limits, as it is just~6.23\% below the designed value.  Inconsistencies with
the variac transformer and a resistance that was slightly below its
rated~\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm} likely contributed to this, along with small
capacitances in the oscilloscopes.

\subsection{Voltage Regulator}
By plotting the data in Table~\ref{tab:ckt3data}, it is possible to get the
accurate depiction of the voltage regulation capabilities of the 1N4740 zener
diode shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ckt3plot}.  Clearly the diode begins regulating
the input voltage at~\SI{10}{\volt}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]

	\input{img/circuit3.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption{Output of the zener diode-based voltage regulator shown in
		Figure~\ref{fig:schem3}, as measured on a DC voltmeter.  A 1N4740 diode
		was used in this test.}
	\label{fig:ckt3plot}}
\end{figure}
%
As was previously stated, the zener diode is neither an ideal regulator nor a
perfect regulator.  Between inputs of~\SI{10}{\volt} and~\SI{20}{\volt}, the
output grows at a rate of~\SI{68.9}{\milli\volt\per\volt}, due to current
leakage.  Above~\SI{20}{\volt}, the output decreases
by~\SI{60}{\milli\volt\per\volt}, most likely due to inefficiencies associated
with the diode package's now increased temperature.

\subsection{Constant Current Source}
The JFET chosen as a constant current source performed quite well for
a~\SI{16}{\volt} drain voltage, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ckt4plot}.  It
provided a constant current of roughly~\SI{5.68}{\milli\ampere} for loads less
than~\SI{2.0}{\kilo\ohm}, after which the current decreased at a rate of
roughly~\SI{0.89}{\milli\ampere\per\kilo\ohm}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/circuit4.tex}
	\parbox{4.25in}{
	\caption{Measured current from the 2N5459 JFET-based constant current
		source described in Figure~\ref{fig:schem4}.  The test was performed
		with a drain voltage of~\SI{16}{\volt} and again at~\SI{32}{\volt}
		while varying the resistance with a decade box.}
	\label{fig:ckt4plot}}
\end{figure}
%
With a~\SI{32}{\volt} drain voltage, the current regulation window is quite
distorted.  Output current remains constant for loads
between~\SI{0.05}{\kilo\ohm} and~\SI{1.0}{\kilo\ohm}, but then increases at a
rate of~\SI{0.06}{\milli\ampere\per\kilo\ohm} until the load
reaches~\SI{4.2}{\kilo\ohm}.  For loads greater than~\SI{4.2}{\kilo\ohm}, the
output current decreases as expected, by
approximately~\SI{.1375}{\milli\ampere\per\kilo\ohm}.
