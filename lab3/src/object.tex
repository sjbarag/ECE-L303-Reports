Experiment was performed with the goal of familiarizing students with the LM723
voltage regulator integrated circuit (IC), as well as more general voltage
regulation concepts.  By the experiment's conclusion, students were expected to
be able to calculate line and load regulation and to be capable of designing a
working voltage regulator IC system.
