\subsection{Step Response}
After completing a simulation of the system's step response, the plot shown
in Figure~\ref{f:stepSim} was produced by PSpice.

	the square signal in red is the input to the system, whereas the green
	curved signal is the output.}
	\label{f:stepSim}}
\end{figure}
%
This same test was repeated for the constructed circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{f:realSchem}, while measuring the output on the in-lab
oscilloscope.  The resulting waveforms are shown in Figure~\ref{f:stepReal}.

	upper signal~(A1) is the input, while the lower~(A2) is the output.}
	\label{f:stepReal}}
\end{figure}
%
While there are similarities between the two resulting output signals, it is
significant to note that the simulated response exhibits Gibbs phenomena on the
leading transition of every wave, while the measured output does not show any
effects of Gibbs' phenomena, in fact failing to exceed the amplitude of the
input.

\subsection{Frequency Response}
% -117.523 - -57.519 dB/dec
The frequency sweep simulation described above produced the plot shown in
Figure~\ref{f:bodePlotSim}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/bodePlotSim.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Simulated Bode Plot]{Resulting data from the PSpice simulation of
	the third-order low pass filter for a sweeping input frequency.}
	\label{f:bodePlotSim}}
\end{figure}
%
As can be seen, the system's frequency response represents a low pass filter
with a corner frequency near the target~$f_c$ of~\SI{363}{\hertz}.  The
terminal slope of the linear region is equal
to~\SI{-60.004}{\decibel\per dec}, which aligns with the expected behavior
of an ideal third-order filter~(i.e.~\SI{20}{\decibel\per dec} for
first-order,~\SI{40}{\decibel\per dec} for second-order, etc.).

When considering the calculated properties of the third-order low pass filter,
MATLAB produces the plot shown in Figure~\ref{f:bodePlotCalc}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/bodePlotCalc.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Calculated Bode Plot]{MATLAB-generated Bode plot for the
	third-order low pass filter.  Note the similarities to the PSpice-generated
	one.}
	\label{f:bodePlotCalc}}
\end{figure}
%
% - 60.0141
Similar to the PSpice-produced plot, MATLAB's resulting Bode plot has a
terminal slope of~\SI{-60.0141}{\decibel\per dec}.  As explained above, this is
reasonably close to the expected behavior of~\SI{-60}{\decibel\per dec} for a
third-order filter.  Additionally, the corner frequency appears to be near the
target value of~\SI{363}{\hertz}.

Finally, the LabView output~(shown in Figure~\ref{f:bodePlotMeas} was
examined to determine if the physical filter's characteristics matched the
simulated and calculated ones.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/bodePlotMeas.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Measured Bode Plot]{LabView-produced data for the constructed
	third-order low pass filter.  It is significant to note that the in-lab
	oscilloscope is not capable of measuring values with sufficient precision,
	resulting in the flat portion just below~\SI{30}{\decibel}.}
	\label{f:bodePlotMeas}}
\end{figure}
%
The frequency response of the system shown above is limited by the in-lab
equipment, which can not measure the output voltage with sufficient precision
to continue the negative trend to the upper bound of the testing range.  This
results in a horizontal component to the gain trend for frequencies above a
certain value, and a decreased slope of only~\SI{-22.1166}{\decibel\per dec}
for the linear region that remains.  This slope suggests that the circuit is
actually first-order, despite the designed characteristics.

When considering all three sources of frequency response on a single set of
axes, Figure~\ref{f:bodePlotComposite} results.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{img/plot/bodePlotComposite.tex}
	\parbox{.6\textwidth}{
	\caption[Composite Bode Plot]{Composite plot of all frequency responses.
	Note the discrepancy between the measured and calculated curves.}
	\label{f:bodePlotComposite}}
\end{figure}
%
As is clear, the resulting curves are all similar until
roughly~\SI{3000}{\hertz}, above which the measured values no longer decrease.
This is a result of the limited precision of the oscilloscopes.
